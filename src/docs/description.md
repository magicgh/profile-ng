I am a senior staff research scientist at [Google Research](https://ai.google/research), where I work on computer vision and machine learning.  

At Google I've worked on [Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/), [Lens Blur](https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/04/lens-blur-in-new-google-camera-app.html), [HDR+](https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/10/hdr-low-light-and-high-dynamic-range.html), [Jump](https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/introducing-next-generation-jump/), [Portrait Mode](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html), [Portrait Light](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/portrait-light-enhancing-portrait.html), and [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf). I did my PhD at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Jitendra Malik and funded by the NSF GRFP. I've received the [C.V. Ramamoorthy Distinguished Research Award](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Students/Awards/15/) and the PAMI Young Researcher Award.
